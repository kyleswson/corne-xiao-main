| Hotswap socket              | 42 | Hotswap sockets for MX-style |
| Diodes 1N4148W              | 44 | Surface mount diodes in SOD123 package |
| EC11 encoder                | 02 | 20 steps, 20 detent Bourns encoder are recommended. You can read more about it here [(Quadrature) Encoders](https://kbd.news/Designing-for-Wireless-1784.html)|
| OLED                        | 02 | [Nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view) is recommended |

| Battery & Battery Connector | 02 | 3.7v lipo battery and S2B-PH-K-S connector |

Note: 
 - Use a battery with a built-in protection circuit.
 - You can directly solder the battery to the large BAT pad (just below the oled connector). If opting for the connector, you'll have to use longer spacers to accommodate them below the pcb.
 - You can solder the power switch on either side of the pcb but I have tested it only on the back side.
 - **This guide assumes you are capable of soldering the diodes, hotswap sockets, power button, encoder and mcu sockets yourself. You can find videos/guides about these stuff very easily. I have only shared some of the extra things you need to take care of.**

**_Shared below are the steps to build the LEFT HALF. Since the pcb is reversible, you can just repeat these but on the opposite side to make a right half._**

### Preparing the controller

We have to solder 3 diode legs to the 3 pads at the back of the xiao. The pads being *BAT+* and the two *NFC* pads at the corner. The other battery pad is ignored as it is internally connected to *GND* pin.

> You can skip soldering either/both NFC pads depending on how you are building, since one of the pad is used for 6th col and one for the CS pin of nice!view. These pins have been marked as "6" and "CS" on the PCB for reference.

- **Tin the pads**

- **Solder the diode legs**

  You can use wires instead of diode legs. Check under [here](https://github.com/friction07/corne-xiao/blob/main/rev1/docs/buildguide.md#pads-at-the-back).

 **Warning**

> Use low temperature for this (I used 260 C). Hold the legs with help of tweezers. Flux will help a lot. Try to make the legs straight which shouldn't be difficult as they are easy to bend. **Do not overheat or use excess force or you may end up lifting the pads**.
I soldered multiple xiao like this. It looks scary at first but it just needs patience.

### Jumpers

- Bridge jumpers on the opposite side for the xiao-ble that is if the xiao is mounted on the front, bridge the jumpers on the back.
- Bridge jumpers on the same side for battery connector.
- Bridge Jumpers on the same side for oled connector (only if you are using oled instead of encoder).

### Solder the controller

- **Push the controller carefully in the pcb**
The image is from rev1 but the process is same for rev2

![push it in](/rev1/docs/images/mcu3.jpg)

- **Solder these legs to the pcb**

Yes, this will make the controller non-removable. You can use pogo pins instead but I wasn't able to find them locally, so I went this route.

### Encoder

Before soldering the encoder, make sure the bottom is non-conductive. Since my encoders had a metallic bottom, I used a piece of kapton tape over the jumpers for oled.

### Both halves together 

Here's how both the halves should look once you are done:
